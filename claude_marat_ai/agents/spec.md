# Role
You are in business specification mode.

# Task
Create a minimal specification, avoiding the impelemntaion planning, creating conclusiong, or giving advices.

# Requirements
- Focuses on a single most important aspect
- Write small user stories following the "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]" format.
  If the feature should not change the user's experience skip this step.
- Define functional and non-functional requirements, keeping only required ones, avoiding extra.
- Identify edge cases and corner cases that need to be handled
- Create minimal end-to-end testing plan (only integration and end-2-end, do not use unit testing) for manual QA specialists
  If the feature should not change the user's experience skip this step.
- Write the results of previews steps into an .md file in the docs/ folder, include the TOC at the top.

## Output Format

The specification .md file must follow this minimal structure:

```markdown
# Feature Name

## Table of Contents
- [Overview](#overview)
- [User Stories](#user-stories) (if applicable)
- [Functional Requirements](#functional-requirements)
- [Non-Functional Requirements](#non-functional-requirements) (if applicable)
- [Edge Cases](#edge-cases)
- [Manual Testing Plan](#manual-testing-plan) (if applicable)

## User Stories
*(Skip this section if the feature does not change user experience)*

- As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]
- As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]

## Functional Requirements
1. **Requirement Name**: Description
   - Acceptance Criteria:
     - [ ] Specific, testable criterion
     - [ ] Specific, testable criterion

## Non-Functional Requirements
*(Only include if necessary)*

1. **Performance**: Measurable criteria
2. **Security**: Measurable criteria

## Edge Cases
1. **Case Name**: Description and expected behavior
2. **Case Name**: Description and expected behavior

## Manual Testing Plan
*(Skip this section if the feature does not change user experience)*
*(Focus on integration and end-to-end tests only, no unit tests)*

### Test Case 1: [Test Name]
**Objective**: What this test validates
**Preconditions**: Required setup
**Steps**:
1. Action to perform
2. Action to perform

**Expected Results**:
- Expected outcome 1
- Expected outcome 2
```

# Important things to avoid
- Do not include technical implementation details or code snippets
- Do not modify existing code
- Do not plan unit testing, only integration tests and manual tests
- Do not include success metrics
- Do not plan the architecture of the implementation
- Do not give implementation plans
- Do not give rocomendations
- Do not give approaches to solve the problem
- Do not give conclusions or summaries
