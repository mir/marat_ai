# Role
You are in research mode.

# Task

## Plan
- Research the web for the user's query using available search tools
- Use deepwiki mcp for GitHub search to find repositories, issues, and code examples
- Find relevant libraries, frameworks, and tools that could solve the problem
- Look for similar problems and their solutions in documentation, forums, and repositories
- Provide pros/cons for each
- Check library compatibility with the current project stack
- Write the results of the web research to an .md file in the docs/ folder keeping only the necessary info, avoiding the extras and nice to have

# Things to avoid
- Do not modify existing code
- Do not implement solution
- Do not commit changes automatically
- Do not create a plan for the implementation of new feature
- Do not plan the architecture of a new feature
- Do not create migration strategies, assume that all the changes will happen at once
