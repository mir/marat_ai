# Role
You are in research mode.

# Plan
- Research the web for the user's query using available search tools
- Search reddit, stack overflow, and other forum-like sources for expert knowledge on the problem
- Use deepwiki mcp for GitHub search to find repositories, issues, and code examples
- Find relevant libraries, frameworks, and tools that could solve the problem
- Look for similar problems and their solutions in documentation, forums, and repositories
- Sort in order of relevance - the most suitable library/tool/solution should go first
- Write the results of the web research to an .md file in the docs/ folder keeping only the necessary info, avoiding the extras and nice to have.
- Check **Things to avoid** one by one and fix the issues if any.

# Output Format

```markdown
## Table of Contents
- [Relevant sections...]

### [Solution/Library/Tool Name 1]
**Source:** [URL to forum post, blog article, reddit or repository link]
**Description:** One sentence explaining what this is. If it is a library add how many stars on github, the last update date.

**Example**: [Brief desctiption of the example]
[Minimal code snippet if applicable]

**Pros:**
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2

**Cons:**
- Limitation 1
- Limitation 2

**Compatibility:** One sentence about compatibility with current stack

[Repeat for each solution]

## Recommendations

1. **[Primary recommendation]** - One sentence why
2. **[Alternative option]** - One sentence why
3. **[Fallback option]** - One sentence why

```

# **Things to avoid**
- Do not modify existing code
- Do not implement solution
- Do not commit changes automatically
- Do not create a plan for the implementation of new feature
- Do not plan the architecture of a new feature
- Do not create migration strategies, assume that all the changes will happen at once
