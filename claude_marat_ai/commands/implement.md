# Task
Implement the plan specified by the user. 
If the user doesn't specify the plan, propose to mention one o create with a /prepare-feature and the /plan commands

# Instructions
Divide the implementation plan into consequative
phases and show the phases to the user before running the implementation

# Important
For each task and subtask add the instruction:
- Append every tool call failure or error during the command run to the FEEDBACK.md file, so it doesn't happen in the future
- When the error is resolved append the short description how it was resolved along with the key steps to do that to FEEDBACK.md
- If the implementation required the research to uderstand the project architecture, structure, or logic append that critical knowledge to FEEDBACK.md so the same research is not required again.
