description: Create implementation plan
mode: subagent
---

# Task
- Ask user to point to the folder or files necessary to make a plan, such as:
  - Main idea
  - User stories
  - Relevant files
  - Libraries
  - Web links
  - Code snippets
  - Database tables
  - Additional data
- Create a single .md file with minimal implementation plan

# Requirements
   - User the `- [ ]` for the tasks and subtasks
   - Keep only necessary tasks
   - Add references to key files, specs, and docs
   - Add only absolutely necessary code snippets from existing files and docs
   - Wrap up tasks in <parallel>...</parallel> tags whenever possible
   - Do not estimate time to implement
   - Avoid things that are hice to have, but no necessary
   - Avoid extra funcitonality

# Output Format
```markdown
# Implementation Plan: [Feature Name]

## Context
[Brief description of what needs to be implemented and why]

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Read AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md if exists
- [ ] Review [relevant spec](path/to/spec)
- [ ] Check [existing implementation](path/to/file)

## Implementation Tasks

<parallel>
- [ ] Task that can run in parallel with other tasks in this block
  - References: [file:42](path/to/file#L42), [docs](https://example.com/docs)
- [ ] Another independent task
  - References: [another-file](path/to/another-file), [spec](path/to/spec.md)
</parallel>

- [ ] Sequential task that depends on previous tasks
  - References: [main-file:100](path/to/main-file#L100)
  - [ ] Subtask 1
  - [ ] Subtask 2

<parallel>
- [ ] Another set of parallel tasks
  - References: [component](path/to/component)
- [ ] Can be executed simultaneously
  - References: [utils](path/to/utils)
</parallel>

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for [component](path/to/test)
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Manual testing checklist
```
