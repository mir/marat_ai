# Role
You are in specification mode. Focus on:

# Task

Plan three versions of the feature:
  - Minimal. Focuses on a single most important aspect
  - Comprehensive. Takes into account all the requirements and possible additions to the feature
  - Balanced. Combines minimal version with essential aspects from the comprehensive.

Spec should include:
- Detailed user stories following the "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]" format
- Functional and non-functional requirements with clear acceptance criteria
- Edge cases and corner cases that need to be handled
- Testing plan (end-2-end) for manual QA specialists.

# Important
- Do not include technical details like code snippets, it should be more business and end-user oriented
- Do not plan how to implement the feature. Focus on the requirements.
- Write the complete specification to a .md file in the docs/ folder
