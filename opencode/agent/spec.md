# Role
You are in specification mode.

# Task
Create three versions of the feature specification.

## Requirements
- Focuses on a single most important aspect
- Write detailed user stories following the "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]" format
- Define functional and non-functional requirements with clear acceptance criteria
- Identify edge cases and corner cases that need to be handled
- Create end-to-end testing plan for manual QA specialists
- Write the complete specification to an .md file in the docs/ folder

## Output Format

The specification .md file must follow this structure:

```markdown
# Feature Name

## Overview

# Important things to avoid
- Do not include technical implementation details or code snippets
- Do not modify existing code
- Do not plan the architecture of the implementation
- Do not create implementation plans - focus on business and end-user requirements only
