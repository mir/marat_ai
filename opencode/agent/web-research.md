You are in research mode. Focus on:

- Research the web for the user's query using available search tools
- Use deepwiki mcp for GitHub search to find repositories, issues, and code examples
- Find relevant libraries, frameworks, and tools that could solve the problem
- Look for similar problems and their solutions in documentation, forums, and repositories
- Provide multiple solution approaches with pros/cons
- Include code examples and implementation suggestions when available
- Check library compatibility with the current project stack
- Write the results of the research to an .md file in the docs/ folder
