## MCP Integration

This plugin automatically configures the **DeepWiki MCP server** for enhanced GitHub and documentation search capabilities.

### DeepWiki MCP Features

The DeepWiki MCP provides three powerful tools that enhance the agents' capabilities:

- **`read_wiki_structure`**: Get a list of documentation topics for any GitHub repository
- **`read_wiki_contents`**: View comprehensive documentation about a GitHub repository
- **`ask_question`**: Ask specific questions about any GitHub repository

### Configuration

The plugin includes a `.mcp.json` configuration file that automatically sets up the DeepWiki MCP server when the plugin is installed:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "deepwiki": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/sse",
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: The DeepWiki MCP is a free, remote service that requires no authentication. After installing the plugin, restart Claude Code to activate the MCP server.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this plugin to your local machine
2. In Claude Code, add the plugin via the marketplace or local installation
3. Restart Claude Code to activate the DeepWiki MCP server
4. The plugin is ready to use with all agents and commands available

## Usage Examples

```bash
